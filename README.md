# Porfolio Website

Source code for my portfolio website. For simplicity the app has been divided into backend
and frontend directories. Frontend src folder contains the code for the general website and
specific project frontend code can be found in project_demos folder. Backend folder contains
all the server side code including project_demo code.

# Projects

## Todo App

Simple ToDo app that uses hooks and functional components. Animation done using framer-
motion library


## Mockup E-commerce clothing shop

An mock-up e-commerce clothing shop implemented with Redux and PostrgreSQL database.
The purpose of this demo is to showcase my skills working with Redux and PostgreSQL.
The mock-up is lacking an user account implementation that would link the shopping 
cart state to each individual user account. I decided to omit user accounts as it
would make the demo too cumbersome (would require account creation).

## Java Random Maze Game

A Java game that generates a random maze each game. Currently no browser
demo available. However you can run the code and play the game by running command 
java -jar maze_game.jar in the root directory.


## How to run

In the frontend folder run npm install and npm start afterwards.
